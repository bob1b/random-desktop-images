This Python3 script changes the background image (Windows 10, Linux/Cinnamon) to a random image
after a given amount of time (if the user is not idle). If the user is idle, the script does not
change the background image until the user is no longer idle.

The image selection is mostly random. However, a truly random image selection could have the same
image repeated multiple times before all of the images have even cycled through.

So, all images are viewed once, at random, before repeating an image.
